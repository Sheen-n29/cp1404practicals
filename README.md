# CP1404 Practicals

## Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404
By Sheen Fernando

This repository is for practicals in the module CP1404. Each week has its own respective folder and all weeks have appropriate pull requests for peer feedback.

What I have learned about clean code in this module:
- Have consistent and appropriate naming conventions for all variables. Make sure that all of them abide by Python standards
- Functions should be focused on one task only, which is following the Single Responsibility Principle
- Comment on your code often so that it is understandable to both yourself and others
